I created this web app as part of my Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree program.

I needed to use IndexedDb to store data

I used webpack to bundle my service worker file so that I could use the idb-promise library by Jake Archibald

I set up my webpack configuration primarily using the 'guides' documentation on the webpack website. 

https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/

I developed the site using the webpack-dev-server

I used Lighthouse to measure web app performance
